	  I love movies and filmmaking. I love making my own films and watching films.
	  <h1> Start </h1>
	  <h3>Ever since I was little, movies have been a huge part of my life. 
	  I have always loved going to the movie theater. 
	  I’ve always been drawn to the art of filmmaking, and the excitement I feel when watching a great film has stayed with me throughout the years.  
	  I got a camera for Christmas one year and have made my own short films and things like that ever since.</h3>

	  <h1> Goals and Inspirations </h1>
	  <h3>I hope to create a good enough short film to submit to a festival. 
	   My ultimate goal is to become a movie director, and I’m determined to work hard and learn as much as I can along the way. 
	   Some filmmakers who inspire me are Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton, and Jim Henson (to name a few).</h3>
